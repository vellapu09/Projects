# Boston Housing Price Prediction Project

## Project Overview

This project involves analyzing the Boston Housing dataset to predict the median value of homes in various Boston districts. Utilizing machine learning techniques, specifically regression analysis, we aim to understand how different features such as crime rate, number of rooms, and proximity to employment centers affect housing prices. The project is divided into two main tasks: Data Exploration and Preprocessing, and Regression Analysis.

## Task 1: Data Exploration and Preprocessing

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Conduct a thorough analysis of the Boston Housing dataset, focusing on understanding the distribution of the target variable and key features.
- Use visualizations like histograms, box plots, and scatter plots to uncover patterns and relationships within the data.

### Feature Scaling

- Discuss the significance of feature scaling in regression analysis and its impact on model performance.

## Task 2: Regression Analysis

### Model Implementation

- Implement and compare several regression models: Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, and Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Regression.

### Model Evaluation

- Use the R^2 score and Mean Squared Error (MSE) to evaluate each model's performance.
- Compare simple linear regression to multiple regression analyses to demonstrate the potential benefits of including more features.

## Deliverables

- A detailed report including EDA findings, a discussion on feature scaling, implementation details for each regression model, and evaluation results.
- A GitHub repository containing all project code, data exploration notebooks, and the final report.


## Getting Started

To replicate this analysis:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed, along with the necessary libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`.
3. Explore the `notebooks/` directory to find the EDA and model implementation notebooks.
4. Review the `src/` directory for custom Python scripts used in model evaluation.

## Project Goal

The aim of this project is to apply, analyze, and compare different regression techniques to predict housing prices accurately. This endeavor will not only enhance predictive modeling skills but also provide insights into the practical application of machine learning techniques in real estate economics.
