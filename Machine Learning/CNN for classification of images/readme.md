### CNN for Classification Project

#### Project Overview
This project demonstrates the application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification tasks. It encompasses the entire machine learning workflow, including data preparation, model architecture design, training, evaluation, and visual analysis of the results. The project aims to provide insights into the effectiveness of CNNs in distinguishing between different classes within a dataset of images.

#### Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow (or Keras)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

Ensure these Python libraries are installed in your environment to run the notebook successfully.

#### How to Run the Notebook
1. Clone this repository or download the notebook file directly to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab installed. If not, it can be installed via Anaconda or pip.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the notebook and launch Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
4. Open the `CNN for classification.ipynb` notebook.
5. Execute the cells in order, from top to bottom, to go through the data preparation, model building, training, and evaluation phases.

#### Data Preparation
The first section of the notebook focuses on preparing the data for training. This involves loading the image dataset, applying necessary preprocessing steps such as normalization and augmentation, and splitting the data into training, validation, and test sets.

#### Model Architecture
This section details the design of the CNN model used for classification. It includes the layers used, activation functions, and other model parameters essential for learning patterns in the image data.

#### Training
The training process involves feeding the prepared data into the CNN model and iteratively adjusting the model weights to minimize the classification error. This section also covers setting the hyperparameters such as the learning rate and the number of epochs.

#### Evaluation
After training, the model's performance is evaluated on a separate test dataset to assess its ability to generalize to new, unseen data. Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are presented to quantify the model's effectiveness.

#### Visual Analysis and Misclassified Examples
The final section provides a visual analysis of the results, including examples of correctly and incorrectly classified images. This analysis helps in understanding the model's strengths and weaknesses in predicting certain classes.

#### Conclusion and Future Work
This project highlights the power of CNNs in image classification tasks, offering a comprehensive guide from data preprocessing to model evaluation. Future work could explore more complex CNN architectures, incorporate larger datasets, or apply transfer learning techniques to improve model performance.
