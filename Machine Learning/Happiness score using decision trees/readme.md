### README.md for the Decision Trees Project

#### Project Overview
This project applies Decision Tree Classifiers to predict happiness levels based on various factors reported in the World Happiness Report data for multiple years. The happiness levels are categorized into 'Weak Happy', 'Moderate Happy', and 'Strong Happy' based on the 'Happiness Score'. The model uses several features for prediction, including 'Economy (GDP per Capita)', 'Family', 'Health (Life Expectancy)', 'Freedom', 'Trust (Government Corruption)', 'Generosity', and 'Dystopia Residual'.

#### Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

Ensure you have the above Python libraries installed in your environment before running the notebook.

#### How to Run the Notebook
1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the notebook file directly.
2. Make sure you have Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab installed. If not, you can install it via Anaconda or pip.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the notebook and launch Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
4. Open the `decision_trees.ipynb` notebook.
5. Run the cells sequentially to load the data, preprocess it, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

#### Dataset
The dataset is sourced from the World Happiness Report, which includes countries' scores based on various factors like economic production, social support, life expectancy, freedom, absence of corruption, and generosity. The notebook focuses on data from multiple years, with preprocessing steps to categorize the happiness scores and other features.

#### Model Training and Evaluation
The Decision Tree Classifier is trained on the preprocessed dataset. The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy scores and classification reports, which provide insights into precision, recall, and F1-score for each happiness category. The notebook includes steps for visualizing the decision tree to understand the decision-making process.

Visualizations and model evaluation metrics are provided to assess the model's effectiveness and understand its decision-making process.

#### Conclusion and Future Work
This project demonstrates the application of Decision Trees in understanding and predicting happiness levels from various factors. Future work could involve exploring more complex models, incorporating additional data sources, or applying the model to predict changes in happiness levels over time.
